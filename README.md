# Forage-Deloitte

## Task 1: Coding
**Task:** Create an algorithm to unify 2 different data models

**Background information:** 

We have signed a new account - Daikibo Industrials, a global leader in the manufacturing of heavy machinery, founded and headquartered in Tokyo, Japan. They needed assistance with a variety of problems and were impressed to find out Deloitte could help in all verticals. Daikibo is in the process of integrating IIoT (Industrial Internet-of-Things) devices to monitor, measure and analyze their manufacturing processes. Half of their infrastructure uses devices streaming telemetry data in one format, and the other half - in another. They need your help to combine the two.

## Task 2: Data Analysis
**Task:** Nuild a dashboard to explore the client's telemetry data

**Background information:** 
Having your data unification algorithm, Daikibo's tech team has converted all telemetry data collected from the 4 factories of the company:

- Daikibo Factory Meiyo (Tokyo, Japan)
- Daikibo Factory Seiko (Osaka, Japan)
- Daikibo Berlin (Berlin, Germany)
- Daikibo Shenzhen (Shenzhen, China)

Each location has 9 types of machines, sending a message every 10 min. Daikibo has been collecting this data for 1 month (May 2021) and they've just shared this data in the form of a single JSON file.

The reason this client wanted to collect telemetry was to answer 2 questions:

1. In which location did machines break the most?
2. What are the machines that broke most often in that location?

## Task 3: Development
**Task:** Prepare a software development proposal

**Background information:** 
Analyzing offline data is great, but having a real-time overview of processes and smart alerts when things break is even better. Our client would like us to build a real-time manufacturing status dashboard. The first task of this process is drafting a development proposal. 

## Task 4: Cyber Security
**Task:** Identify the security issue which led to a leak of private company information

**Background information:** 
A big news publication has revealed sensitive private information of Daikibo Industrials' – a production problem has caused their assembly lines to stop, threatening the smooth operation of supply chains relying on Daikibo’s products. The client suspects the security of their new status board may have been breached.

## Task 5: Forensic Technology
**Task:** Help your team to complete an investigation into unfair pay

**Background information:** 
After a worrisome number of internal complaints on gender inequality (in terms of pay), Daikibo Industrials wants us to help them investigate.

The Forensic Tech team has built an algorithm to quantify “level of gender pay equality” for most/all job roles within the company, in all company locations. Our Forensics lead thinks it will be a great welcoming task for you to finish the job.
